# Lobstr Foundation App

### Welcome Aboard Project LOBSTR
*Learn Ocean Based Scuba Techniques Reliably.*

We are building a **FOSS Progressive Web App**, with the aim of revolutionising the issuance of certifications. We are building on top of [Nostr](https://nostr.how/en/what-is-nostr), an open protocol that enables truly censorship-resistant and global value-for-value publishing on the web.

## Technical Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): a powerful framework built on top of **React**, that also enables the ability to develop a monolith (Client and API in the same repo).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): a utility-first CSS framework that runs on build-time, allowing for server-side rendering of components, improving the performance of our application.
- [NDK (Nostr Dev Kit)](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk): a development kit use to interact with Nostr Relays.
